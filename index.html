                    <p>Hi,</p> 
                    <p>I'm Clayton B from Louisiana. Full-time job by day, full-stack developer by night. To be fair, the full stack developer part is still in the works. I actually haven't even chosen the stack I want to learn first. I say first because I do like the open-ended nature of the programming industry. If I change my mind about web development, I could pursue automation, AI, video games, etc. So far this has proven to be quite an undertaking and is the farthest pursuit from overnight as possible. Just this portfolio page was a months long project...mostly because of my beginner level but still...</p>

                    <p>As time goes on, I intend on updating this page as the general bulletin board of my online presence. I'm not too big into social media and I have learned that the connections made are invaluable. If you're looking for a programming/coding buddy, follow me on GitHub!</p>

                    <p>Because I'm still in beginner stages of my learning path, the best content I can provide at this point is found in the Hashnode blog. Ideally, I would be able to create a feed from the blog to this page. This page could end up being entirely built with JavaScript or PHP... Hoping you will come back to see.</p>

                    <p>All the best, <br>
                    Clayton</p>
